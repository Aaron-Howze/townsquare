# Project history and goals

FreeGeek Chicago has hoped to create software like this for ages. It took about
5 years to begin work on Townsquare. During those years, most organizational
information could be tracked via paper records entered into shared spreadsheets,
conversations could be supported by email lists, and documentation relied on
a mix of Google Docs and a standard issue overly-complex wiki for documentation.
 
Townsquare is meant to address these needs, and our development schedule is 
ruled by how much each area hurts. Townsquare has replaced FreeGeek's 
"Spreadsheet of Doom" for volunteer tracking, while the email list and wiki
remain.
